# mdx-project-repo
We, students of MDX London, are using this repository to manage collaborative changes to our code. 
Rather than having to send files every which way so we can all have the updated version, we have chosen GitHub to manage changes and versions. 

This is a project assigned to us as part of our course. 
That is all. Good day.
